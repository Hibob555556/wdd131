                    <p>Hey! My name is Cayden. For work I am a Product Test Engineer and Developer. I enjoy
                        photography
                        and
                        seeing how far I can take dirt roads before they end in my Jeep. I enjoy writing code in C# and
                        have
                        been working on a program which automatically documents C# code into a markdown file when you
                        commit
                        your changes to a git repository. I do a lot of work with weather stations and renewable energy
                        for
                        work. I particularly enjoy working with any sort of solar sensor. I have built a solar tracker
                        which
                        can fit a full size solar panel from scratch. This has allowed me to greatly improve my testing
                        capabilities at work by being able to directly point sensors at the sun which allows me to test
                        for
                        longer periods each day.</p>
                    <h3>Utah, United States</h3>
                    <img src="images/utah_flag.avif" alt="Utah's state flag" class="flag">
                    <p class="state-content">Utah is a beautiful state full of nature and wildlife. You can see
                        everything from
                        desert, to snow capped mountains, and everything in between. Utah is known for its 5 national
                        parks including Zion, Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef. Utah was admitted into
                        the Union on January 4th 1896 making it the 45th state. Preceding this, the Pioneers reached and
                        settled utah in 1847.
